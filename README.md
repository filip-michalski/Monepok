# Monepok
Pok√©mon-like console RPG game.

We choose 6 creatures from a pool of randomly generated creatures.<br>
The goal of the game is to defeat all opponents in the game. <br>
In a given turn, we can: attack, use a skill, replace a creature or evolve.<br>
After losing all HP, the creature faints and cannot be used.<br>
Each creature has a set of characteristics (strength, agility, hp, skill, exp). <br>
Skills are divided into offensive and defensive, as well as stuns and buffs. <br>
Each Monepok also has a type (Earth, Air, Water, Ice, Fire, Steel) that affects other types.<br>
Monepok can evolve - you then choose two attributes that will increase.<br>
